console.log("\n1. INTELLIGENT OBSTACLE DETECTION:");
console.log("   ‚Ä¢ Line-rectangle intersection detection");

console.log("   ‚Ä¢ Primary strategy: Direct elbow paths based on connection points");
console.log("   ‚Ä¢ Alternative strategy: L-shaped routing with different waypoints");
console.log("   ‚Ä¢ Extended routing: Goes around obstacles when direct paths fail");
